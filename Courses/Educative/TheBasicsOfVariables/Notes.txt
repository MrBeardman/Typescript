Declaring with var
is funcion scoped when declared inside a fucnion 
but global scoped when declared outside of a fucntion
Doesnt stop me when redefining the same variable and overides 
inital value in declaration/initialization

Declarign with let
setting the lifespan of the variable at the scope it was declared
determined by curly braces

Shoudl be used when defining an iterative in a loop
so tis value is avaliable only inside that loop

as a ruel of thumb, var is never used since let and const provides cleaner scope definition
