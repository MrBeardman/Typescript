MODULES
provides organization(container) 
example:
import {Component ,OnInit} from '@angular/core';
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit{}


ROUTES
containts a path and component reference
we can navigate to routes using routerLink directive using history.pushState,we set a base.ref tag to our index.html //we can use 
//back and forward buttons to navigate trought the app

COMPONENTS

we have:
Templates
Is html that tells angular how to rened a component
include data bindings and other components and directives
Class
Properties and methofs of the component class are avaliable to the template
Services

Zip template and a class together
Metadata alow angluar ro procees them and put htem together 
most common is @Component() decorator
takes a config otpion with the selector, templateUrl,styles,styleUrls,animations,etc

Databinding enables data to flow from the component to template and vice-versa
includes interpolation, property Bidning etc
for example:
{{value}}
[property] = "value"
(event) = "handler()"
[(ngModel)] = "property //two way for example filling forms

DIRECTIVES
 are a class decorated with @directive
 A Component is jsut a directive with added template

 SERVICES 
 is generally jsut a class
 should do one specific thing
 takes the burden of bussines login out of a component
 it is consider best pracise to always use @INJECTABLE so that metadata is generated correctly
